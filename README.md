# What's this then?

It's a JavaScript practice exercise designed to add form interaction into DOM elements explored in previous exercises, all of which is part of a software development course. This was the 31st "lab" exercise assigned as part of the coursework. As usual, the instructions and starting code we were provided with at the beginning of the exercise are in `task.md` and `startpoint` respectively.

The first chunk of this was done as a trio with [Heather Lamont](https://github.com/HeatherLamont) and [Abi Johnson](https://github.com/AbiJays) (up to the second commit). After that, I had to start my day job, so I finished the rest myself (as did Heather and Abi, presumably).

# What do I do with it?

Very little!

If you want to mess around with it, one way you could do so is to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and its [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension, then use them to open the contents of this repository in a browser of your choice. It isn't very exciting, though.

There's no licence here, because it's not really anything worth licensing. Just don't blame me (or indeed Heather or Abi) if you somehow break your computer and we'll be awright.
